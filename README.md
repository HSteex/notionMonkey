# Notion Enhances

**Notion Enhances** is a custom script for **Violentmonkey** that adds a set of visual and usability improvements to **Notion Gallery Layouts**. The enhancements are accessible through a dedicated menu button located in the top bar (next to the page options). You need to refresh to apply the changes.

## Features

- **Background Gradient**  
  Applies an animated gradient background to items in a Notion database, based on the selected property value (see "Property for Color" option).

- **Colored Borders**  
  Adds a colored border to items, using the same logic as the gradient.

- **Property for Color**  
  Allows you to define which property (by index number) to use as the color source. This property must be visible in the current view to work correctly.

- **Toggle Properties**  
  Show or hide the property fields of items in a Notion board or gallery view, helping reduce visual clutter. You can use this feature by pressing "Alt + \"

## Installation

1. Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) in your browser.
2. Add this script to Violentmonkey.
3. Navigate to your Notion page and click the **Enhances** button in the top bar to access the settings.
